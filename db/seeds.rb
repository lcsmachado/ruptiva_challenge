# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:

User.create(first_name: "Maikel", last_name: "Bald", email: "maikel@ruptiva.com", password: "ilikeruptiva", password_confirmation: "ilikeruptiva", role: "admin")
